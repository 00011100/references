- ---] Summary

Service accounts have pre-authentication features enabled on service accounts. Prevents bruteforcing. Sometimes you will configure an account to not require pre-authentication. If pre-authentication is ever disabled, you can spoof the service and reach out to the DC and get a valid and ENCRYPTED TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket). You will say "I am this user" and the DC will not validate it because pre-authentication is disabled.

If the password is weak, you can crack the TGT and get the password for that account.
You now have credentials for that account! :)


- ---] How it Works
=====================

AS-REP Roasting has the same IDEA of Kerberoasting but is different in the fact that an account needs “Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication”. For Kerberos v5 you have to manually go in and disable Kerberos pre-auth. Maybe you would do this for backwards compatibility with Kerberos v4 libraries, which by default a password was not required for authentication. Another difference between the two, is AS-REP requests a Kerberos Authentication Ticket (TGT) not a service authentication ticket (TGS).


- ---] Quick Commands
======================

# Cracking with hashcat
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt -o cracked.txt


- ---] Kerbrute

Kerbrute will enumerate valid usernames from a list by constructing AS-REQs to reuqesting a TGT from the KDC. If no domain is specified, it will attempt to look a DC up via DNS and SRV records.

# Standard usecase
kerbrute userenum -dc 10.1.11.120 -d XOR.com users.txt

# Downgrade Hash (Sometimes you will get a hash that is not compatible with hashcat. You will need downgrade to convert the hash for you.)
kerbrute userenum -dc 10.1.11.120 -d XOR.com users.txt --downgrade





- ---] impacket

# Another method for as-rep roasting, similar to kerbrute
impacket-GetNPUsers -usersfile users.txt -dc-ip 10.11.1.120 DOMAIN/


- ---] Misc Notes
======================

[+] The hash you want for hashcat is: $krb5asrep$23$ (notice $23$)
